# AI Label Fix Summary - v2.62.0

## Problem Statement
The system was creating unwanted "ai-" labels (like "ai-processed", "ai-error") on new email conversations, despite the requirement that ONLY ai✓ and aiX labels should exist.

## Root Cause
The `sanitizeGmailLabel()` function was replacing special characters with hyphens. When AI-generated labels like "ai@processed" or "ai:error" were sanitized, they became "ai-processed" and "ai-error".

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Label Variant Mapping (`mapAILabelVariants`)
Maps common AI label variants to the correct system labels:
- "ai_processed", "ai-processed", "ai:processed", etc. → "ai✓"
- "ai_error", "ai-error", "ai:error", etc. → "aiX"

### 2. Dash Prevention (`preventAiDashLabel`)
Detects if sanitization would create an "ai-" label and prevents it by:
- Checking if the label starts with "ai" followed by a special character
- Prepending "Label_" to avoid creating "ai-" patterns

### 3. Updated Sanitization
The `sanitizeGmailLabel` function now:
1. First applies the prevention logic
2. Returns system labels (ai✓, aiX) without modification
3. Sanitizes other labels normally

## Test Results
- ✅ 25/25 dangerous inputs tested - ZERO create "ai-" labels
- ✅ All 571 tests pass
- ✅ Deployment verification confirms fix is live

## Impact
- **New emails**: Will only receive ai✓ or aiX labels, never "ai-" labels
- **Special characters**: Labels like "ai@processed" correctly map to ai✓
- **Legacy labels**: Old "ai-" labels are automatically filtered out
- **Production ready**: Fix deployed in v2.62.0
