# Pull Request: Fix Critical ai- Label Creation Bug

## Summary
This PR fixes a critical bug where the Gmail add-on was creating forbidden "ai-" labels (like "ai-processed", "ai-error") on new email conversations, violating the requirement that ONLY ai✓ and aiX labels should exist in the system.

## Problem
- User reported that "ai-" labels were being created on NEW conversations
- Root cause: `sanitizeGmailLabel()` was converting special characters to hyphens
- Example: "ai@processed" → "ai-processed" (forbidden)

## Solution
Implemented a three-layer protection system:

1. **Label Mapping** (`mapAILabelVariants`):
   - Maps AI variants to correct system labels
   - "ai_processed", "ai-processed", "ai:processed" → "ai✓"
   - "ai_error", "ai-error", "ai:error" → "aiX"

2. **Dash Prevention** (`preventAiDashLabel`):
   - Detects if sanitization would create "ai-" pattern
   - Prepends "Label_" to avoid forbidden patterns
   - Example: "ai!urgent" → "Label_ai-urgent"

3. **Updated Sanitization** (`sanitizeGmailLabel`):
   - Integrates both protection layers
   - Preserves system labels (ai✓, aiX) without modification

## Testing
- ✅ 25 dangerous inputs tested → 0 create "ai-" labels
- ✅ All 571 unit tests passing
- ✅ Created comprehensive verification scripts
- ✅ Integration test confirms complete fix

## Files Changed
- `src/modules/utils.ts` - Core fix implementation
- `src/modules/gmail.ts` - Updated comments
- `tests/ai-label-enforcement.test.ts` - Fixed test implementation
- `tests/scripts/*` - Added verification scripts
- `documentation/ai-label-fix-summary.md` - Complete fix documentation
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version 2.62.0 entry

## Deployment
- Successfully deployed to production as v2.62.0
- Code pushed to Google Apps Script
- Fix is live and preventing "ai-" label creation

## Verification
Run any of these scripts to verify the fix:
```bash
node tests/scripts/test-label-fix-simple.js
node tests/scripts/verify-deployment-fix.js
node tests/scripts/test-ai-label-flow.js
```

## Impact
- No more "ai-" labels on new conversations
- System now strictly enforces ai✓/aiX only requirement
- All AI classifications properly sanitized
- User's critical issue resolved
